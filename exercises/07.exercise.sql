-- Merging Results with Union
-- Write a query that will print the manufacturer of phones where the phone's price is less than 170.  Also print all manufacturer that have created more than two phones.

-- IMPORTANT: You don't need to wrap each query with parenthesis! Your solution should not have any parens in it.

-- Hint:

-- To find the manufacturers who have created more than two phones, you can group by manufacturer then apply a 'HAVING' filter to only consider groups with a COUNT(*) > 2

-- For reference, here is the phones table:
